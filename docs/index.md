Hello friend!

In these pages you will find notes, reflections, thoughts.

Overall they form a study, a journey in constant becoming, a discovery. We will never reach the end because there is no end, just as there is no unique and defined beginning. Everything is in evolution, everything is change.

We can only shape moments of solidity to hold onto. What remains in the background is pure potential.

Let's unveil together what will be formed in these fragments, what will be created, by observing, accepting and embracing without hindering the path. It is a continuous discovery of an unexplored territory for which there are no detailed maps, only scattered clues from a distant past.

We should be the ones to draw the map, each its own, unique and unrepeatable one. We will discover its contours, defining the landscape and what it contains, as if it were an irresistible secret game.

Let's discover ourselves, unveiling ourselves, and help each other along this wonderful journey, the most challenging and fascinating one we could ever undertake.

Have a good adventure!
